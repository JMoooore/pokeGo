# pokeGo
- pokeGo is a Pokedex CLI tool written in Golang.
- I am actively building out functionality but it currently has:
  - map -> shows list of 20 locations, subsequent calls show more locations
  - mapb -> shows previous list of 20 locations
  - help -> shows a breakdown of commands
  - exit -> exits the REPL
